## abstract
The extraction of visual elements, such as images, graphs, and tables from documents, is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Previously a complex process, the new Azure Document Intelligence preview API (python SDK: 1.0.0b4 / REST API: 2024-07-31-preview) simplifies the extraction of cropped images as a native feature. This streamlined approach allows users to efficiently capture and utilize visual data, leading to improved document analysis and more comprehensive RAG implementations. A sample Python script illustrates the process of extracting and saving images as PNG files for further use.

## image extraction

In many documents, images, graphs, and tables contain critical information that often complements, or even surpasses, the relevance of the accompanying text. For effective Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), it is essential to index this visual data alongside the textual content. Neglecting to capture information from images, tables, or other figures results in incomplete data retrieval and diminishes the quality of answer generation when using a Large Language Model (LLM). Therefore, extracting and indexing this information is vital for achieving optimal performance.

Historically, extracting visual elements from documents has been a complex task. It required converting bounding regions into bounding box coordinates and frequently involved using external Python frameworks, adding significant complexity to the process.

However, with the introduction of Azure Document Intelligenceâ€™s new preview API version (python SDK: 1.0.0b4 / REST API: 2024-07-31-preview), this process has become significantly streamlined. The API now enables the extraction of cropped images as a native feature of the document analysis method. This is a major advancement, especially for customers who heavily rely on Azure Document Intelligence. By integrating this functionality into the SDK, the product becomes even more powerful, allowing for more efficient inclusion of visual elements, leading to improved accuracy and more comprehensive results in RAG workflows.

Below you will find a quick python sample which outlines the extraction process:

```python
from azure.ai.documentintelligence import DocumentIntelligenceClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
import dotenv
import os
from azure.ai.documentintelligence.models import AnalyzeDocumentRequest, ContentFormat, AnalyzeOutputOption,AnalyzeResult

dotenv.load_dotenv(override=True)

dic = DocumentIntelligenceClient(os.getenv("AzureDiEndpoint"), AzureKeyCredential(os.getenv("AzureDiKey")))

img = open("path to your image","rb")

poller = dic.begin_analyze_document(
    "prebuilt-layout",
    AnalyzeDocumentRequest(bytes_source=img.read()),
    output_content_format=ContentFormat.MARKDOWN,
    output=[AnalyzeOutputOption.FIGURES]
)
res: AnalyzeResult = poller.result()
resultid = poller.details.get('operation_id')

if res.figures:
    for figure in res.figures:
        if figure.id:
            response = dic.get_analyze_result_figure(
                model_id=res.model_id, result_id=resultid, figure_id=figure.id
            )
            with open(f"{figure.id}.png", "wb") as writer:
                writer.writelines(response)

```

This process will extract all figures and images identified by the Document Intelligence analysis and save them as PNG files. These files can then be easily utilized for subsequent operations. In the context of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, for instance, the extracted PNG files can be used to generate descriptions that are embedded alongside the document text, ensuring no information is overlooked.
